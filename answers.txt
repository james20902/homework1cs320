What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge and rebase do the same thing, apply changes from one branch to another.
Merge will preserve commit history across both branches while rebase is destructive
and will copy the commit history from branch A and put it into branch B so that B shows
a single history with commits representing changes from branch A.
