What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge and rebase do the same thing, apply changes from one branch to another.
Merge will preserve commit history across both branches while rebase is destructive
and will copy the commit history from branch A and put it into branch B so that B shows
a single history with commits representing changes from branch A.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository functions almost exactly as a normal one, except 
you can access it either on another local server or a totally remote
server. With this, you can collaborate with other people on the same
repository, commit history and all, without needing the .git file locally.
